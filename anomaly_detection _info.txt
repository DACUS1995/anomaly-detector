- Isolation Forests
- Random Cut Forest
- VAE (computing the difference between input and the reconstructed array)

Algorithms for anomaly detection:
 - For metrics (number  of  running  processes,  available  memory, context  switches  per  second,  processor  load,  free  disk  space, number  of  logged-in  users, and  many  others.)
	* moving z-score
	* discord discovery
 - In logs
